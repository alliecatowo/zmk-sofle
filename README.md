This repository contains the ZMK firmware and configuration for the **AllieCatKeeb**, a custom-built Sofle split keyboard.

## Documentation

For full details on flashing, configuration, and hardware, please see our official documentation:

*   **[Read the GitBook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/3H4WaN1tEms6khZUHFAb/s/rPqJa63N36I6Y3X2pLjt/)**
*   **[Explore the GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/alliecatowo/zmk-sofle/wiki)**

The documentation is managed in the `/docs` directory of this repository.

## Quick Flash

Pre-built firmware can be downloaded from the **Artifacts** section of the latest [GitHub Actions build run](https://github.com/alliecatowo/zmk-sofle/actions/workflows/build.yml).

*   **Standard Mode**: `alliecat_keeb_studio_left.uf2` + `alliecat_keeb_standard_right.uf2`
*   **Dongle Mode**: See the [Dongle Mode Setup Guide](docs/dongle-mode.md).

### Flashing Steps

1.  **Enter Bootloader**: Double-tap the reset button on your keyboard half. It should appear as a `NICENANO` or `XIAO` drive.
2.  **Copy Firmware**: Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the drive.
3.  **Repeat**: Do the same for the other half.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Firmware (Easiest)

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/alliecatowo/zmk-sofle/actions)
2. Click the latest successful build
3. Download the firmware artifacts
4. Flash according to your setup:
   - **Standard Mode**: `alliecat_keeb_studio_left.uf2` + `alliecat_keeb_standard_right.uf2`

### Option 2: Fork and Build (Customizable)

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `config/alliecat_keeb.keymap` to customize your layout
3. Run `./scripts/setup-local-build.sh` to set up the ZMK workspace and fetch modules
4. Push changes to trigger automatic builds
5. Download firmware from Actions tab

### Option 3: Manual Build Triggers

Go to Actions ‚Üí Build ZMK Firmware ‚Üí Run workflow and choose:
- **All**: Build everything (default)
- **Standard**: Left-side master configuration only
- **Dongle**: Unified receiver configuration only
- **Reset Only**: Settings reset firmware only

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

This project is configured for the Eyelash Sofle, which typically uses:
- **Controllers**: 2x Nice!Nano v2 (3x for dongle mode)
- **Displays**: 2x Nice!View (or 128x64 OLEDs)
- **Dongle Display**: 1x 128x64 OLED

**Note:** The Eyelash Sofle is sold as a pre-built kit on AliExpress, so no
hardware assembly is required. You only need to flash the firmware provided in
this repository.

## üöÄ CI/CD - Continuous Integration

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and automate tasks.

### Branch Protection (Manual Setup Required)
To prevent broken changes from being merged into `main`, you should enable branch protection.

1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Branches**.
2. Click **Add branch protection rule**.
3. Set **Branch name pattern** to `main`.
4. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
5. Select the `build` job from the status checks list.
6. Click **Save changes**.

This will ensure that all firmware variants build successfully before a pull request can be merged.

## üì¶ Release Management

This repository uses a system that combines automated changelogs with manual release tagging to give you full control over the release process.

### Versioning
We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `v1.2.3`). To create a new version, create a new Git tag:
```bash
# Example for a new minor version
git tag v1.3.0
git push origin v1.3.0
```

### Automated Changelog
A `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically generated based on your commit history. To update it, go to **Actions** > **Generate Changelog** and run the workflow.

### Creating a Release
1. **Generate the changelog** using the GitHub Action.
2. **Create a new release** on GitHub from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alliecatowo/zmk-sofle/releases).
3. **Choose the Git tag** you created (e.g., `v1.3.0`).
4. **Copy the relevant section** from `CHANGELOG.md` into the release description.
5. **Add your release notes** and classify the release (e.g., "Pride," "Normal," or "Shame") in the description.

## üìö GitBook Documentation

This repository is GitBook-ready. GitBook creates a beautiful, user-friendly documentation site from your `docs` folder.

### Manual Setup Required
1. Go to [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
2. Create a new space and choose to sync it with a GitHub repository.
3. Select your `zmk-sofle` fork.
4. GitBook will automatically detect your `docs` folder and `SUMMARY.md` file to build your site.

Your documentation will be publicly available and automatically updated whenever you push changes to your `main` branch.

## Keyboard Displays

Each half uses the [zmk-nice-oled](https://github.com/mctechnology17/zmk-nice-oled) screen library. The left side shows the standard layout while the right is flipped so both displays face the user and show layer and Bluetooth status. The separate dongle screen is unchanged.

## Dongle Display

The dongle firmware uses the excellent [zmk-dongle-display module](https://github.com/englmaxi/zmk-dongle-display) by `englmaxi`. This provides a rich status screen with widgets for:

*   Active HID indicators (Caps/Num/Scroll Lock)
*   Active key modifiers
*   Bongo Cat (because why not?)
*   Highest active layer name
*   Output status (USB/Bluetooth)
*   Peripheral battery levels

## Resources

*   **ZMK Documentation**: For firmware customization and feature information, refer to the [official ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs).
*   **Sofle Keyboard**: Learn more about the original keyboard design [here](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/).

## Flashing Instructions

For the most reliable setup, it is highly recommended to first flash the `settings_reset` firmware to clear any old pairing data, and then flash the main firmware in the correct order.

### Step 1: Reset All Devices (Recommended)

1.  Put your **Dongle** into bootloader mode (double-tap the reset button).
2.  Copy the `settings_reset_dongle.uf2` file to the drive that appears.
3.  Repeat this process for the **Left** and **Right** halves, using `settings_reset_left.uf2` and `settings_reset_right.uf2` respectively.

### Step 2: Flash Main Firmware in Order

After resetting, flash the main firmware. **The order is important.**

1.  **Flash Dongle First**: Put the dongle in bootloader mode and copy `alliecatkeeb_dongle_central.uf2` to it. The dongle must be running first to accept connections from the keyboard halves.
2.  **Flash Left Half**: Put the left half in bootloader mode and copy `alliecatkeeb_left_peripheral.uf2`.
3.  **Flash Right Half**: Put the right half in bootloader mode and copy `alliecatkeeb_right_peripheral.uf2`.

Once flashed, the halves will automatically connect to the dongle.

## Repository Management

This repository is set up with automated workflows for:

*   **Building Firmware**: Triggered on push to `main` or manually.
*   **Keymap Diagram**: Automatically updates on changes to `*.keymap`.
*   **Changelog Generation**: Creates a `CHANGELOG.md` upon release.
*   **Wiki Publishing**: Syncs the `docs/` folder to the GitHub Wiki.
