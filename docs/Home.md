### Option 2: Fork and Build (Customizable)

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit `config/alliecat_keeb.keymap` to customize your layout
3. Push changes to trigger automatic builds
4. Download firmware from Actions tab

### Option 3: Manual Build Triggers

Go to Actions ‚Üí Build ZMK Firmware ‚Üí Run workflow and choose:
- **All**: Build everything (default)
- **Standard**: Left-side master configuration only
- **Dongle**: Unified receiver configuration only
- **Reset Only**: Settings reset firmware only

## üéØ Features

  - Dongle mode with unified receiver
- **Display Support**: OLED and Nice!View e-ink displays
- **RGB Underglow**: Customizable lighting effects
- **Low Power**: Optimized for battery life
- **Automated Builds & Keymap Diagrams**: CI/CD integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

This project is configured for the Eyelash Sofle, which typically uses:
- **Controllers**: 2x Nice!Nano v2 (3x for dongle mode)
- **Displays**: 2x Nice!View (or 128x64 OLEDs)
- **Dongle Display**: 1x 128x64 OLED

## üöÄ CI/CD - Continuous Integration

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions to ensure code quality and automate tasks.

### Branch Protection (Manual Setup Required)
To prevent broken changes from being merged into `main`, you should enable branch protection.

1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Branches**.
2. Click **Add branch protection rule**.
3. Set **Branch name pattern** to `main`.
4. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**.
5. Select the `build` job from the status checks list.
6. Click **Save changes**.

This will ensure that all firmware variants build successfully before a pull request can be merged.

## üì¶ Release Management

This repository uses a system that combines automated changelogs with manual release tagging to give you full control over the release process.

### Versioning
We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `v1.2.3`). To create a new version, create a new Git tag:
```bash
# Example for a new minor version
git tag v1.3.0
git push origin v1.3.0
```

### Automated Changelog
A `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically generated based on your commit history. To update it, go to **Actions** > **Generate Changelog** and run the workflow.

### Creating a Release
1. **Generate the changelog** using the GitHub Action.
2. **Create a new release** on GitHub from the [Releases page](https://github.com/alliecatowo/zmk-sofle/releases).
3. **Choose the Git tag** you created (e.g., `v1.3.0`).
4. **Copy the relevant section** from `CHANGELOG.md` into the release description.
5. **Add your release notes** and classify the release (e.g., "Pride," "Normal," or "Shame") in the description.

## üìö GitBook Documentation

This repository is GitBook-ready. GitBook creates a beautiful, user-friendly documentation site from your `docs` folder.

### Manual Setup Required
1. Go to [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
2. Create a new space and choose to sync it with a GitHub repository.
3. Select your `zmk-sofle` fork.
4. GitBook will automatically detect your `docs` folder and `SUMMARY.md` file to build your site.

Your documentation will be publicly available and automatically updated whenever you push changes to your `main` branch.

## Keyboard Displays

Each half uses the [zmk-nice-oled](https://github.com/mctechnology17/zmk-nice-oled) screen library. The left side shows the standard layout while the right is flipped so both displays face the user and show layer and Bluetooth status.

## Dongle Display

The dongle firmware uses the excellent [zmk-dongle-display module](https://github.com/englmaxi/zmk-dongle-display) by `englmaxi`. This provides a rich status screen with widgets for:

*   Active HID indicators (Caps/Num/Scroll Lock)
*   Active key modifiers
*   Bongo Cat (because why not?)
*   Highest active layer name
*   Output status (USB/Bluetooth)
*   Peripheral battery levels

## Resources

*   **ZMK Documentation**: For firmware customization and feature information, refer to the [official ZMK documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs).
*   **Sofle Keyboard**: Learn more about the original keyboard design [here](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/).

## Flashing Instructions

You can find pre-built firmware files ready for flashing in the "Artifacts" section of the latest GitHub Actions build run.

1.  **Reset to Bootloader**: Double-tap the reset button on the PCB.
2.  **Flash Firmware**: Drag and drop the appropriate `.uf2` file onto the `NICENANO` or `XIAO` drive that appears.
    *   `alliecatkeeb_left_peripheral.uf2` -> Left Half
    *   `alliecatkeeb_right_peripheral.uf2` -> Right Half
    *   `alliecatkeeb_dongle_central.uf2` -> Dongle

If you encounter issues, flash the `settings_reset.uf2` firmware to all devices first, then flash the main firmware.

## Repository Management

This repository is set up with automated workflows for:

*   **Building Firmware**: Triggered on push to `main` or manually.
*   **Keymap Diagram**: Automatically updates on changes to `*.keymap`.
*   **Changelog Generation**: Creates a `CHANGELOG.md` upon release.
*   **Wiki Publishing**: Syncs the `docs/` folder to the GitHub Wiki.
